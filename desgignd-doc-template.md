## Open Issues [^6]


## Links and docs [^7]



[^1]: Overview of the component, what it does and how it works
[^2]: Purpose of the component, why we need it
[^3]: Implementation details, what we're going to use to implement the component. If we're going to use a library, we have to add the link to the documentation.
[^4]: We have to always update the Requirements and make tests according to them. If we make a fix we have to be sure to test the other requirements before the PR get merged. A philosophy that we can use is: "before start a new feature, we have to be sure to know which are the requirements and how we're going to test them"
[^5]: We have to always update the Revision history and updates in the requirements section. Because we're base our test according to them. If we make a fix we have to be sure to test the other requirements before the PR get merged.
[^6]: This section it's optional. We can add here any issue that we found during the development of the component. Or any technical debt
[^7]: We have to add here any link or documentation that we use to develop the component. Also our internal documentation links if we have any. Just to have everything related to the feature close to the developer
